\brief A class to make analog measurements with the Serial Wombat.

The SerialWombatAnalogInput class is used to make measurements on a given pin.

Any analog-capable pin may be used to make a measurement.

Averaging of samples and first order IIR filtering (1 kHz sampling) of input are available

For a good explanation of 1st order FIR filter calculations, see:
https://www.monocilindro.com/2017/04/08/how-to-implement-a-1st-order-iir-filter-in-5-minutes/

Some filter cut-off (3dB down) frequency and constant values:
      - 0.5 Hz  65417
	  - 1 Hz 65298   
	  - 2 Hz 65062
	  - 5 Hz 64358
	  - 10 Hz 63202

Filtering adds lag.  The higher the filter constant value, the longer it takes for the filter to settle 
when given a steady input.

Declare and initialize a SerialWombatAnalogInput instance for each pin being used as an analog input.

The SW4B_ard_analogInput example included with the Arduino library shows how to use this class.
